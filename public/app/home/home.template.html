    <h3>Welcome</h3>
    <p>I started learning HTML and CSS in 2017 and decided that I liked it. I thought that web development would be a good career change for me so, with a little encouragement from my family, I decided to go to a Seattle code school called Code Fellows. I found that I really enjoy web development and the satisfaction that comes from working with a team to solve problems and create a product.</p> 

    <p>While I enjoy web development, it is not the only career path that interests me. I have always had an great interest in video games and would love to work towards a job in game development in the long term. For the time being however, I am ready and willing to learn and gain invaluable work experience in any computer programming field.</p>
